# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment

**Problem statement:** To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

**Conclusions**
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library

- Model is still overfitting

- The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.

- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
